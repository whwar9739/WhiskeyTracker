        *   Image upload for bottle.
    *   **Tasting Notes (General):**
        *   Rich text field for general tasting notes (aroma, palate, finish, overall thoughts) per whiskey.
    *   **Rating:**
        *   Assign a 1-5 star rating to each whiskey.
        *   Visual display of ratings.
    *   **Whiskey Detail View:**

    *   **Search and Filtering (Basic):**
        *   Search by distillery, name, region, tags.
        *   Initial filters for country, region, category.
    *   **Whiskey Database & Data Management (Foundation):**
        *   Allow users to create fully custom whiskey entries.
        *   Begin work on the structure for a central whiskey database (even if not fully populated yet).
        *   Administrator role (basic user management capabilities).
    *   **Non-Functional:**
        *   **Scalability:** Ensure the database schema can handle growing entries.

## Phase 5: Future Considerations & Community (Post-Initial Major Release)

*   **Goal:** Explore features that extend beyond individual use, such as community aspects or advanced integrations, based on user feedback and business goals.
*   **Key Features from PRD (Section VIII & others):**
    *   **Group Collaboration Features:** (Groups/clubs, shared inventory, collaborative infinity bottles, group tasting sessions, notifications).
    *   Integration with external whiskey databases or APIs.
    *   Advanced search and filtering options (e.g., by bottle image, if deemed valuable).
    *   Further enhancements to import/export.

    *   Explore monetization options (if applicable).
    *   Ongoing maintenance and feature enhancements based on KPIs and user feedback.

---
*This phased approach allows for iterative development, gathering feedback at each stage, and delivering value to users progressively. The "Non-Functional Requirements" and "Design Considerations" should be addressed continuously throughout all phases, with specific focuses as noted. Open issues (e.g., image file size limits) will need to be resolved as they become relevant in their respective phases.*
